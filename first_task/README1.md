In Task 1, we set up a basic Go server to handle HTTP requests and JSON responses. The server includes two endpoints: a GET /api/health endpoint to check server health, which returns a success status in JSON format, and a POST /api/message endpoint that accepts and validates a JSON payload. If the message field is present, the server responds with a success message; otherwise, it returns an error indicating invalid input. We thoroughly tested both endpoints using Postman to ensure proper handling of success and error cases.
